        <h3>CPS - A Tool for Classification and Prediction of Autism with STA</h3>
        <p>Autism diagnostic procedure is a subjective, challenging and expensive procedure and relies on behavioral,
          historical and parental report information. In previous researches, it was investigated that whether it is possible to
          detect autism based on eye-movement sequences, in particular, proposed to use Scanpath Trend Analysis (STA) which
          is designed for identifying a trending path of a group of users on a web page based on their eye movements.
          <br>
          <br>
          This CPS Tool first identifies the trending paths of people with autism and neurotypical people. To detect whether or not a
          person has autism, the similarity of the participant's path to the trending paths of people with autism and neurotypical people
          is calculated. If the path is more similar to the trending path of neurotypical people, the person is clasified as a neurotypical
          person. Otherwise, the person is clasified as a person with autism.
          <br>
          <br>
          CPS provides a prediction, not a diagnosis for a participant. To be able to reach a successful result, this tool has some restrictions
          for file uploading and collecting eye-tracking data. The uploaded eye-tracking data should be in a .txt file form consisting of six attributes
          which are fixation index, timestamp, fixation duration, fixation x-coordinate, fixation y-coordinate and stimuli name.
